        <h2>~ A funny story ~</h2>
        <p>A few years ago I was on a holiday with my Girlfriend to 'Gran Canaria'. We chilled at the pool a bit and then decided to get dressed so we could go out and eat.
            <br> We were playing around a bit as we were ready to head out, so she runs out and closes the door behind her. I was chasing after her but realised I forgot my wallet inside, so I walked back to grab it.
            Then out of nowhere I heard a scream outside in the hallway of the hotel. <br> I go outside and I see my girlfriend crying of laughter on the floor. Ofcourse I knew right then that she did something stupid. <br>
            "What did you do ?" I asked her. On which she replied: <br> "I jumpscared an old man thinking it was you coming my way."
        </p>
        <h3>TL;DR</h3>
        <p>My girlfriend almost gave an old man a heart attack.</p>
